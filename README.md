# EXPRESS JS

This file teaches you to create an Express Server.

## Steps to create a Server

### Basic setup

1. npm init -y    --> To install NPM
2. npm install express  --> To install express dependencies

### Building the app

1. Create index.js --> First point of contact
2. Look for the file for how to do it?
3. Run the app using node <filename>
4. Mostly you will get 4** error bcoz there are no API Routes

### Creating Routes

1. Go to index.js again and have a look at the configuration for routes section
 > Install nodemon for hot-reloading
 >> npm i -D nodemon --> -D only for developers not in production
